Instructions to run the examples:

1. 'cd' to /code/ directory
2. Type 'dotnet run'

Welcome screen will appear and game-play instructions will be displayed. There are two ways to proceed from here -

Either 
1. Copy-paste the entire example and you will just see the output.

Or (this is how it is supposed to be played) 
2. Type the instructions individually line by line and see how everytime you type 'next' a year is progressed and new PDF is opened. 'exit' stops the progressions and displays the output



PDF outputs will be generated and saved two-folders up from the /code/ directory. PDFs will also open in your default PDF opener app
